USAGE: osm-p2p-sync TARGET-1 TARGET-2

  Sync two osm-p2p-db destinations.
  
  TARGET-{1,2} can either be an osm-p2p directory, or an osm-p2p sync file.

  The command will auto-detect syncfiles vs osm-p2p directories.

  If one of the destinations does not yet exist, include a trailing /
  character to indicate an osm-p2p directory is desired; otherwise a sync
  file will be created.
